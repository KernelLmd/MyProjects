2. Using the Python Interpreter
2.1. Invoking the Interpreter
A second way of starting the interpreter is python -c command [arg] ..., which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shellâ€™s -c option. Since Python statements often contain spaces or other characters that are special to the shell, it is usually advised to quote command in its entirety with single quotes.
